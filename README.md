**LETS GET PUMPED!**

## Requirements

You will need `nodejs` and `npm`. These can be retrieved from your system's package manager.

Dependencies can be installed for the root level, the client, and the server with `npm i`

The `server/.env` file will also need to be set up for a working MongoDB database.

## Usage

From the root of the repository, the whole app (front and backend) can be started with:

```bash
npm run dev
```
